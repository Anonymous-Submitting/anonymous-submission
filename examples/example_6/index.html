    <h1>Understanding Bayes' Theorem</h1>

    <p>Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes how to update the
        <span class="tooltip" title="A measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.">probability</span>
        of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. It is named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, who formulated the theorem in the 18th century. The theorem is widely used in statistics, machine learning, and data analysis.</p>

    <p>The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:</p>
    <p><code>P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)</code></p>

    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight" title="The updated probability of a hypothesis after considering new evidence. It reflects the revised belief about the hypothesis.">P(A|B)</span> is the <strong>posterior probability</strong> of A given B.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight" title="Measures how likely the evidence is under a specific hypothesis. It is crucial for updating beliefs in Bayesian inference.">P(B|A)</span> is the <strong>likelihood</strong> of B given A.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight" title="The probability of an event occurring before any evidence or information is taken into account. It can be based on previous knowledge or assumptions.">P(A)</span> is the <strong>prior probability</strong> of A.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight" title="The probability of an event irrespective of other variables.">P(B)</span> is the <strong>marginal probability</strong> of B.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For example, suppose you want to determine the probability of having a disease given a positive test result. Using Bayes' Theorem, you can update the probability based on the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence" target="_blank" class="hyperlink">prevalence</a>
        of the disease, the accuracy of the test, and other relevant factors.</p>
