    <h1>Ferdinand de Saussure: A Founding Figure in Linguistics</h1>
    <p>Ferdinand de Saussure, a Swiss linguist, is often considered one of the founding figures of modern linguistics. His work laid the groundwork for <span class="highlight term">structuralism</span>, a key framework in linguistic theory. One of his most influential contributions is the idea of the <span class="highlight term">linguistic sign</span>, which consists of two components: the <span class="highlight term">signifier</span> and the <span class="highlight term">signified</span>. The <span class="highlight term">signifier</span> refers to the physical form of a word or sound, while the <span class="highlight term">signified</span> is the mental concept or meaning associated with that word. Together, these two elements create the <span class="highlight term">linguistic sign</span>, which forms the basis of meaning in language. Saussure's theories on the structure of language continue to influence modern linguistic thought and are central to the study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism" target="_blank">structuralism</a>.</p>
