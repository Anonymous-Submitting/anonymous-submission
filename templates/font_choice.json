    "text": "Ferdinand de Saussure, a Swiss linguist, is often considered one of the founding figures of modern linguistics. His work laid the groundwork for structuralism, a key framework in linguistic theory. One of his most influential contributions is the idea of the **linguistic sign**, which consists of two components: the **signifier** and the **signified**. The **signifier** refers to the physical form of a word or sound, while the **signified** is the mental concept or meaning associated with that word. Together, these two elements create the **linguistic sign**, which forms the basis of meaning in language. Saussure's theories on the structure of language continue to influence modern linguistic thought and are central to the study of **structuralism**.",
